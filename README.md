# League of Legends Victory Analysis

In this project, exploratory data analysis was performed on an unclean League of Legends data set using Python. The scope of this project is to determine which key map objectives most statistically significantly influential towards a player winning or losing a ranked solo-queue match.

The conclusion of the analysis is that bot lane turrets, bot lane inhibitor, and Baron Nashor are the most influential key map objectives that statistically significantly indicate whether a player will win or lose a game.
